The service instance will not appear on Resource List and billing of the instance stops from next month. IBM Cloud retains the service instance for 7 days and in case you need to restore the same instance back, please raise a support ticket for "IBM Cloud for Education" in 7 days upon deleting instance from IBM Cloud UI.
