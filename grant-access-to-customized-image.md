# Granting Customized User Group to Access a Customized Image Group
{: #grant-access-customized-image}

This method can define a group users to access a group of images. It can be useful when you have a special image or images only want to be used by a restricted group of users.

2.	Create an user group by clicking on **Manage Groups**, then click **Add new User Group**.

3.	Choose the user group name and its privilege, then click **Add Group**.

4.	You can add any user to that group by usersâ€™ school ID.

5.	Add Image Group by clicking  **Add New Resource Group**.

6.	Choose **Image** as **Type**, and input the name you like.

7.	Use the same way in [Adding Image to Image Pool](/docs/cloud-for-education?topic=cloud-for-education-creating-updating-images) to add images to your new image group.

8.	Send your user group name and image group name to **cldedu@us.ibm.com**. We will assign proper resource mapping.
